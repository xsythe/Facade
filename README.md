About
=====
Facade is a 3D adventure game in the style of Myst.

It's designed to be incredibly immersive, with very little in-game UI, speculative loading and a compelling storyline. Adventure games aren't mindless violence that merely hone your reflexes. A good adventure game doesn't tell a story. It shows the story. Facade is puzzle-based, but it's not just about the puzzles.
